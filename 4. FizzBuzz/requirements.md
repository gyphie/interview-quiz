# FizzBuzz

Write an algorithm that, for the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive), 

1. outputs 'Fizz' when the number is divisible by 3
2. outputs 'Buzz' when the number is divisible by 5
3. outputs 'FizzBuzz' when the number is divisble by 3 and 5
4. outputs the number when the number does not meet the above requirements

The output should:

1. be a single string.
2. separate lines with '\n'.
3. format each line with the number and the output. Example: "3 Fizz\n", "4", "5 Buzz\n", "6\n", ... , "15 FizzBuzz\n"
